## [Refactor Controllers: Improve Code Quality, Logging & Error Handling]

### 1. Summary

- Refactors all controller files to improve code quality, consistency, and maintainability
- Implements structured logging across the application replacing console statements
- Adds comprehensive ESLint configuration for API-specific naming conventions
- Enhances error handling with explicit return statements and better validation

---

### 2. Changes Made

- **ESLint Configuration**
  - Added `ignoreDestructuring: true` to camelcase rule
  - Whitelisted common API snake_case variables (`article_id`, `user_id`, `created_at`, etc.)
  - Maintains code consistency while accommodating database naming conventions

- **Logging System**
  - Replaced all `console.log` and `console.error` statements with structured logger
  - Added contextual logging with object metadata for better debugging
  - Implemented consistent log levels (info, warn, error) across controllers

- **Error Handling & Control Flow**
  - Added explicit `return` statements to all controller methods
  - Ensures proper response handling and prevents multiple responses
  - Standardized error propagation patterns with `return next(err)`

- **Input Validation Improvements**
  - Replaced `isNaN()` with `Number.isNaN()` for more accurate validation
  - Added missing validation for topic creation fields
  - Enhanced comment validation with better error messaging

- **Code Quality Enhancements**
  - Added clarifying comments for complex logic
  - Improved destructuring patterns (`const { file } = req`)
  - Standardized response patterns across all endpoints
  - Enhanced security by removing sensitive data from responses

---

### 3. Reason for Changes

- **Maintainability**: Structured logging makes debugging and monitoring easier in production
- **Reliability**: Explicit returns prevent potential double-response errors that could crash the server
- **Code Quality**: ESLint configuration ensures consistent code style while accommodating API requirements
- **Security**: Better input validation and data sanitization reduces vulnerability surface
- **Developer Experience**: Clear patterns and comments make the codebase easier to understand and contribute to
